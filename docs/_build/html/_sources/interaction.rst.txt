Methodes
________

   :meth:`defer`: None
      'Defers' the response, showing a loading state to the use.

      .. warning::
         If you dont respond with an message using :meth:`respond` 
         or edit the original message using :meth:`edit` within less than 3 seconds,
         discord will indicates that the interaction failed and the interaction-token will be invalidated.
         To provide this us this method

      .. note::
         A Token will be Valid for 15 Minutes so you could edit the original :attr:`message` with :meth:`edit`, :meth:`respond` or doing anything other with this interaction for 15 minutes.
         After that time you have to edit the original message with the Methode :meth:`edit` of the :attr:`message` and sending new messages with the :meth:`send` Methode of :attr:`channel`
         (you could not do this hidden as it isn't an respond anymore and also you could not pass more than one :class:`Embed`)

   :meth:`respond`: Union[:class:`discord.Message`, :class:`discord.EphemeralMessage`] 
      You could pass the same Paramerts as using :meth:`discord.Messageable.send` but there are two more optional:
         
      * :attr:`embeds` Optional[List[discord.Embed]]
         An :class:`list` containing up to 10 Embeds that should send with the respond.
      * :attr:`hidden` Optional[Bool]
         If set to ``True``, the message will be only vible for the :attr:`author` of the Interaction and will disapears  if the :attr:`author` click on ``delete this message`` or reloads the client.
            
         .. note::
            If you send an ``hidden`` (emphemberal)-respond, discord dont returns any data like an message you could edit,
            **but** you could resive Interactions when the Author interact with an component

      Responds to an interaction by sending a message that can be made visible only to the person who invoked the interaction by setting the :attr:`hidden` to ``True``.
